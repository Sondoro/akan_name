## Project description.
Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. The project builds a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then outputs their Akan Name based on their gender.
